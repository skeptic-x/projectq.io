`Topic`&nbsp; Who "Men" can Marry   
`Verses in Topic`&nbsp; 8  
`Topic Description`&nbsp; Quran allows men to marry up to 4 women, orphan girls and enslaved girls and mentions payment/inheritance/mahr for the transitional marriage.     
`Highlights`&nbsp; 4 Now   

=== "Sahih International"
    And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].
=== "Yusuf Ali"
    If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.
=== "Mohsin Khan"
    And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphanÂ­girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.
