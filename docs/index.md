# What is ProjectQ?
ProjectQ is a collection of data and analysis around verses in Quran from the modern lens of Social Justice, Human Rights, Gender Equity and Science.


We want a world where religious dissent is accepted. ProjectQ aims to provide one more tool for Exmuslimsâ€™ tool belt in their journey out of the cult of Islam.

Feel free to search or browse verses from the menu. (Currently only 26 verses from chapter 4 are available, more verses will be available as they get tagged)
## Projects
