# :fontawesome-solid-book-skull: What is Project Q?
Project Q is a collection of data, projects, analysis, visualizations and tools around data-driven analysis of verses in Quran from the modern lens of Social Justice, Human Rights, Gender Equity and Science.


We want a world where religious dissent is accepted. Project Q aims to provide one more tool for Exmuslims’ tool belt in their journey out of the cult of Islam.

## :tools: Who will this benefit?
We Exmuslims are tired of hearing things like:  

“Quran has a whole chapter dedicated to women!” - _Well how much of this chapter is truly dedicated to women? Let's quantify gender bias!_  
“You are just pointing one bad thing in Quran, there are many more good things in Quran...” - Good for whom? Let's quantify male privilege!  
  
It is not a surprise that there are way too many sites that glorify Quran, but it’s hard to find sites that look at these verses critically and from Social Justice, Human Rights, Gender Equity and Scientific points of view.  These are the values and reasons why most Exmuslims leave Islam.
