=== "Sahih International"
    And the two who commit it among you, dishonor them both. But if they repent and correct themselves, leave them alone. Indeed, Allah is ever Accepting of repentance and Merciful.
=== "Yusuf Ali"
    If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.
=== "Mohsin Khan"
    And the two persons (man and woman) among you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, punish them both.

Surely, Allah is Ever the One Who accepts repentance, (and He is) Most Merciful.
